        "Coriolis force",
        "Buoyancy"
      ],
      "answer": "Coriolis force",

      ],
      "answer": "Takeoff and landing phases",
      "explanation": "Low-level wind shear (including microbursts) is particularly dangerous during takeoff and landing due to low altitude and reduced margins."

      ],
      "answer": "Deflects to the left of motion",
      "explanation": "In the Southern Hemisphere, moving air is deflected to the left relative to its motion by Coriolis force."
