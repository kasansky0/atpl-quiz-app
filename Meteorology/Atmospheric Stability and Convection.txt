      "options": [
        "A measure of stability based on surface pressure only",

      ],
      "answer": "A moist layer just above a strong updraft leading to rapid condensation",
      "explanation": "A strong updraft encountering moist stable layer can produce cap (pileus) clouds as air is rapidly lifted and condensed at that level."
