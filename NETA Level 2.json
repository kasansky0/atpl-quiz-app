    "answer": "Dry nitrogen above the liquid",
    "explanation": "Sealed tank transformers use dry nitrogen above the oil to prevent oxidation and moisture ingress. 'No intentional space' is incorrect because some gas space is needed. Dehydrating compounds are used in open-breathing transformers, not sealed. Forced air cooling is a separate cooling method, and an oxygen blanket would promote oxidation, not prevent it."

    "answer": "Include electric stress relief at terminations and splices",
    "explanation": "Shielded power cables concentrate electric stress at terminations and splices, so stress relief devices are required to prevent insulation failure. While insulation, enclosures, and proper grounding are important, the key requirement is electric stress control. They can be spliced properly and do not prevent magnetic fields."

    "answer": "1000A",
    "explanation": "Ampacity of a bus bar depends on its cross-sectional area and material. A 1/4 inch by 4 inch copper bus has a cross-section of 1 sq.in., which typically carries about 1000A under normal conditions. Smaller sizes carry less, and larger sizes carry more."

    "answer": "Concentric neutral cable",
    "explanation": "Concentric neutral cable is widely used in rural underground distribution because it provides a grounded neutral by wrapping neutral wires around the insulation. Other types like interlocked armor, jacketed, belted, or strand shielded cables are used for specific mechanical protection or insulation purposes but not typically for rural underground distribution."

    "answer": "Capacitor",
    "explanation": "A capacitor trip device (CTD) is used when no external DC battery source is available. It stores energy in a capacitor, which discharges rapidly to trip the breaker when needed. This provides reliable tripping power without a dedicated battery system. The fastest way to identify this is to note that 'capacitor' indicates stored electrical energy, just like a battery replacement."

    ],
    "answer": "800",
    "explanation": "The **frame rating (1600A)** represents the maximum mechanical size and capacity of the breaker, but the **sensor rating (800A)** determines its actual maximum continuous current rating. The settings LT=1.1X, ST=2X, and Inst=6X control trip timing and protection but do not increase the continuous ampere rating. \n\n**Calculation:**\n- Continuous rating = sensor size = 800A.\n- LT (long-time) setting = 1.1 × 800A = 880A, but this is the trip delay threshold, not a continuous rating.\n\n✅ **Fastest way to find the answer:** Look for the **sensor rating**, not the frame or setting multipliers — the sensor defines the breaker’s continuous ampere rating."

    "answer": "Disconnect switch",
    "explanation": "A **disconnect switch** (also called an isolator) is designed **only to open or close a circuit when no significant current is flowing** — it provides a visible means of isolation but **is not rated to interrupt load current**. Interrupting load current with a disconnect can cause arcing and equipment damage. \n\n**Calculation / Fastest way to determine:**\n- If the device name includes **“breaker”** or **“switch”** designed for load (like load-break switch), it **can interrupt current**.\n- If it’s only called a **disconnect** or **isolator**, it’s **for isolation only**, not load interruption."

      "The contact of the circuit breaker will become polished",
      "This situation can never occur"
    ],
    "answer": "The circuit breaker will itself fault",
    "explanation": "A **circuit breaker’s interrupting rating** is the maximum fault current it can safely interrupt **without failing or exploding**. If a breaker rated for 25,000A is subjected to a 50,000A fault, the fault current **exceeds its capability**, causing severe arcing, contact destruction, and possibly an internal explosion — meaning **the breaker itself will fault**. \n\n**Fastest way to determine:** Compare the available fault current to the breaker’s interrupting rating:  \n→ If **Fault Current > Interrupting Rating**, the breaker **cannot safely interrupt** and will **fail**."

      "Be rated non less than 125% of the sum of the continuous and non-continuous load",
      "Be rated no greater than the sum of the continuous and non continuous load"
    ],
    "answer": "Be rated non less than the non-continuous load plus 125% of the continuous load",
    "explanation": "According to **NEC Article 215.3** and **NEC 210.20(A)**, overcurrent protection for feeders and branch circuits must be rated **not less than 125% of the continuous load plus 100% of the non-continuous load**. This ensures that circuit breakers and fuses do not trip under normal continuous operation.\n\n**Formula:**  \nOvercurrent device rating ≥ (1.25 × Continuous Load) + (1.0 × Non-Continuous Load)\n\n**Example:**  \nIf continuous load = 80A and non-continuous load = 20A,  \n→ Rating = (1.25 × 80) + (1 × 20) = 120A.  \nSo, the next standard size breaker would be **125A**.\n\n**Fastest way to find:**  \nMultiply continuous load by **1.25**, then simply **add the non-continuous load**."

    "answer": "magnetic or instantaneous",
    "explanation": "A **magnetic or instantaneous circuit breaker** trips instantly when a high fault current (short-circuit) is detected. It operates using an **electromagnetic mechanism** that responds to current magnitude rather than time, making it ideal when **short-circuit protection** is the only requirement.\n\n**Why others are wrong:**\n- **Thermal overload:** protects against long-term overload, not short-circuits.\n- **Long time protected:** designed for continuous overloads, not instant faults.\n- **Ground fault:** protects against earth leakage, not short-circuit faults.\n- **Fused:** provides similar protection but isn’t adjustable or reusable like breakers.\n\n**Fastest way to identify:**\nIf the question mentions **“short-circuit only”** → look for **instantaneous or magnetic** type breaker.\n\n**Calculation concept:**\nThe trip occurs almost instantly when the current exceeds a set multiple of rated current — typically **8× to 12× In (rated current)** for instantaneous trip breakers.\n\nExample: For a 100A breaker, instantaneous trip ≈ 800A–1200A."

    "answer": "Stored energy operated",
    "explanation": "Medium voltage interrupter switches are typically **stored energy operated** to ensure rapid and reliable opening and closing under load. The stored energy mechanism allows consistent operation regardless of operator strength. Motor or coil operation is slower or auxiliary. Hook stick operation is manual and unsafe for standard rated interrupters. Non-load breakers cannot interrupt full load current.\n\n**Fastest way to identify:** Any standard MV switch designed for load and fault interruption uses **stored energy** for reliability and speed."

    "answer": "Thermal magnetic",
    "explanation": "Motor controllers typically use **thermal-magnetic circuit breakers**, which combine a **thermal element** for overload protection and a **magnetic element** for short-circuit protection. \n\n**Why others are wrong:**\n- **Thermal overload:** only protects against sustained overloads, not instantaneous faults.\n- **High interrupting capacity:** describes capability, not type.\n- **Molded case with fuse:** is a different protection method.\n- **Drawout:** refers to physical mounting, not protection type.\n\n**Fastest way to identify:** Motor starters need **overload + short-circuit protection** → choose **thermal-magnetic breakers**."
